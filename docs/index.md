# Welcome

This package has been wroten for classfiying valid textiles from invalid ones.

A deep learning approach based on PyTorch has been chosen to build the model.

Scikit-Learn has been used to calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and to plot ROC and precision-recall curves, and also for plotting confusion matrices.

MLFlow has been chosen to log parameters, metrics, checkpoints, figures during training and testing.

You can find the source code on GitHub (https://github.com/srahmatian/texture_classification)
